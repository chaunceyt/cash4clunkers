I'm hoping someone here has a way to scrape this PDF: http://www.cars.gov/files/disposal-salvage/ELVS.pdf (283 pages)
into csv.

Have you tried the "-layout" option to pdftotext?  After you use that, just pull out lines in the text file matching the regular expression

^\s*(.+?)\s{2,}(.+?)\s{2,}(.+?)\s{2,}(\d+)$

That is, some lines begin with white space.  All columns are separated by two or more white spaces, and all rows end in all-numeric unique IDs.  Rows which don't match that pattern are the superfluous "State" separators or other junk.  If you wanted to break down the city, state, ZIP, you could use 

^\s*(.+?)\s{2,}(.+?)\s{2,}(.+?) (..) (\d{5})\s{2,}(\d+)$

Hope that helps,
Joe
